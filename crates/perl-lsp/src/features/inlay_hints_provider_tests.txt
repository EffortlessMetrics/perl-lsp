This file marks that the inlay hints provider has been updated to work with the new AST structure.

Changes made:
1. Extended get_node_children() in declaration.rs to handle all NodeKind variants
2. Updated visit_children() in inlay_hints_provider.rs to handle modern Perl constructs
3. Fixed get_parameter_names() to properly check builtin signatures
4. Added comprehensive tests for modern Perl syntax

The provider now correctly traverses:
- Try/catch/finally blocks
- Given/when/default statements
- Method definitions with signatures
- Signature parameters (mandatory, optional, slurpy, named)
- Nested control flow structures
- Eval and do blocks
