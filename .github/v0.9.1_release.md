# Perl LSP v0.9.1 - Initial Public Alpha

## Release Date
February 20, 2026

## Overview

Perl LSP v0.9.1 is the **Initial Public Alpha** release. This milestone brings a fast, native Perl language server implementation to the community. While feature-complete in many areas, this is an early-stage release intended for testing and feedback. The project targets v0.15.0 for its formal Stability Contract; APIs and wire protocol may change based on community input.

## Key Highlights

- **Fast native parser**: Recursive descent parser written in pure Rust (1-150us typical parse times).
- **Broad LSP coverage**: ~91% of LSP 3.18 methods implemented (alpha-validated).
- **Sub-millisecond incremental updates**: Real-time parsing with 70-99% node reuse.
- **Complete semantic analysis**: 100% AST node coverage with proper lexical scoping.
- **Debug Adapter Protocol**: Initial DAP support via bridge to Perl::LanguageServer.
- **Cross-platform**: Pre-built binaries for Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (x86_64, aarch64), and Windows (x86_64).

## What's New in v0.9.1

### Complete Semantic Analyzer
All NodeKind handlers implemented across Phases 1, 2, and 3. Proper lexical scoping with nested scope support, package-qualified call resolution, and shadowed variable detection. Cross-file definition and reference resolution via dual indexing.

### Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) Support
Initial debugging capabilities in VS Code and DAP-compatible editors. Phase 1 bridge to Perl::LanguageServer with cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, WSL). Performance targets: <50ms breakpoint operations, <100ms step/continue.

### Enhanced LSP Cancellation
Thread-safe cancellation infrastructure with <100us check latency and atomic operations. JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant `$/cancelRequest` handling. Parser integration preserves incremental parsing capabilities.

### Code Actions and Refactoring
Extract variable/subroutine with intelligent parameter detection. Import management: remove unused, add missing, sort alphabetically. Cross-file refactoring with dual indexing for broad reference coverage.

### Security Hardening
UTF-16 boundary vulnerability fixes. Path traversal prevention for all file operations. Command injection hardening. Process isolation with safe defaults.

## Installation

```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install perl-lsp

# Install DAP server (optional)
cargo install perl-dap

# Or quick install script (Linux/macOS)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EffortlessMetrics/perl-lsp/master/install.sh | bash
```

## Platform Support

| Platform | Architecture | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Linux (GNU) | x86_64 | Tier 1 |
| Linux (musl) | x86_64 | Tier 1 |
| Linux (GNU) | aarch64 | Tier 1 |

## Breaking Changes from v0.8.x

- **MSRV**: Minimum Supported Rust Version bumped to 1.92 (Rust 2024 edition).
- **Legacy parser**: `perl-parser-pest` marked as deprecated (maintenance only).
- **Position helpers**: Legacy position conversion functions replaced with symmetric converters.
- **Error types**: `ParseError` structure restructured for better error recovery.

## Roadmap

- **v0.10.0** (planned): Enhanced DAP native implementation, Moo/Moose semantic depth.
- **v0.15.0** (future): Formal Stability Contract with locked wire protocol and API guarantees.
- **v1.0**: General Availability (timeline TBD).

See [`docs/STABILITY.md`](docs/STABILITY.md) for the full stability policy.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed incremental parsing node reuse efficiency.
- Resolved dual indexing edge cases for broader reference coverage.
- Fixed scope resolution for nested packages and shadowed variables.
- Resolved race conditions in concurrent LSP request handling.
- Eliminated timeout issues in CI environments.
- Achieved 100% CI pass rate with adaptive threading.
