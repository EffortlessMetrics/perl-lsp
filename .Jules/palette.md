## 2024-05-22 - [Broken Command Registration]
**Learning:** UX commands defined in package.json must have corresponding registrations in code to be discoverable/functional, even if they proxy to built-in actions.
**Action:** When auditing commands, check package.json against registered commands in extension.ts to ensure no "dead" UI elements exist.

## 2026-01-29 - [Command Palette Context Filtering]
**Learning:** Commands in the Command Palette are often visible globally by default. Using the `when` clause in the `menus.commandPalette` contribution point is essential to prevent cluttering the global palette with context-specific actions (like "Run Tests").
**Action:** Always verify if a command should be globally available or scoped to specific file types/contexts via `when` clauses in `menus.commandPalette`.

## 2026-01-29 - [Placeholder UI Elements]
**Learning:** Exposing placeholder or "coming soon" features in main UI menus (like Status Menu) is considered a UX regression if the commands are not fully functional, even if they provide a "roadmap" message.
**Action:** Only add commands to high-visibility menus (like Status Menu) if they perform a functional action immediately; avoid "dead" or "informational only" interaction points for core tasks.

## 2026-02-14 - [Context-Aware QuickPick Actions]
**Learning:** VS Code's `QuickPickItem` supports a `disabled` property (in newer APIs), but visually communicating unavailability via label suffixes (e.g., "(Not available)") is clearer for users than relying solely on UI state, especially when the reason for disabling is context-dependent (e.g., wrong file type).
**Action:** When creating dynamic menus, explicitly mark unavailable actions as disabled and update their labels to explain why, rather than hiding them or letting them fail.
