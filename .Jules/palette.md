## 2024-05-22 - [Broken Command Registration]
**Learning:** UX commands defined in package.json must have corresponding registrations in code to be discoverable/functional, even if they proxy to built-in actions.
**Action:** When auditing commands, check package.json against registered commands in extension.ts to ensure no "dead" UI elements exist.

## 2024-05-24 - [Command Palette Context Filtering]
**Learning:** Commands in the Command Palette are often visible globally by default. Using the `when` clause in the `menus.commandPalette` contribution point is essential to prevent cluttering the global palette with context-specific actions (like "Run Tests").
**Action:** Always verify if a command should be globally available or scoped to specific file types/contexts via `when` clauses in `menus.commandPalette`.
