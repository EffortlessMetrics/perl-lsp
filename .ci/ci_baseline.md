## Notes

- **Median Duration:** 50th percentile of run duration (in seconds)
- **P95 Duration:** 95th percentile of run duration (in seconds)
- **Billable Minutes:** Estimated billable time (each run rounded up to nearest minute)
- **Success Rate:** Calculated excluding skipped runs

## Recommendations

Based on this baseline:

1. **Monitor P95 durations** - Workflows with high P95 vs median ratio may have reliability issues
2. **Success rate targets** - Aim for >95% success rate on critical workflows
3. **Cost optimization** - Focus on high-billable workflows for optimization efforts
