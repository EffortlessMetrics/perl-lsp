# GitHub Issue: Re-enable Disabled Corpus Property Tests

## Issue Description

Several property tests in the perl-corpus crate were disabled for the v0.8.3 release due to "proptest regex issues". These tests should be re-enabled and fixed to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

## Issue Details

**Title:** Re-enable corpus property tests disabled for v0.8.3 release

**Labels:** `testing`, `proptest`, `enhancement`, `good-first-issue`

**Assignee:** To be determined

**Milestone:** v0.8.4 or later

## Affected Tests

The following property tests were disabled with `#[ignore = "proptest regex issue - not critical for release"]`:

1. **`/crates/perl-corpus/src/gen/quote_like.rs`**:
   - Line 128: `test_prop_quote_like_basic_parsing`
   - Line 136: `test_prop_quote_like_delimiter_variations`
   - Line 145: `test_prop_quote_like_complex_content`

2. **`/crates/perl-corpus/src/gen/whitespace.rs`**:
   - Line 142: `test_prop_whitespace_generation`

3. **`/crates/perl-corpus/src/gen/heredoc.rs`**:
   - Line 174: `test_prop_heredoc_basic_generation`
   - Line 192: `test_prop_heredoc_complex_delimiters`
   - Line 198: `test_prop_heredoc_edge_cases`

## Root Cause

These tests were disabled because they were causing flaky failures due to proptest regex generation issues, likely related to:
- Invalid regex patterns being generated by proptest strategies
- Edge cases in the regex generators that produce unparseable constructs
- Timeout issues with complex generated test cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 7 disabled proptest tests are re-enabled
- [ ] Tests pass consistently without flakiness
- [ ] Root cause of regex generation issues is identified and fixed
- [ ] Test strategies are hardened to prevent invalid input generation
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests successfully

## Implementation Plan

1. **Investigate the specific failures** that led to these tests being disabled
2. **Review proptest strategies** for regex/quote-like/heredoc generation 
3. **Add input validation** to prevent invalid test cases
4. **Consider reducing test case counts** or timeouts if needed for CI performance
5. **Add better error handling** for edge cases in the generators
6. **Test thoroughly** across different platforms and Rust versions

## Priority

**Medium** - These tests provide valuable coverage but were not blocking the v0.8.3 release. Should be addressed in the next minor release.

## Additional Context

The perl-corpus crate provides comprehensive test case generation for the Perl parser. These property tests are important for ensuring the parser handles edge cases correctly, so re-enabling them is important for long-term code quality.

The tests were disabled as a quick fix for the v0.8.3 release timeline, but they should be properly fixed rather than permanently disabled.
