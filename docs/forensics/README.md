# PR Forensics

This directory contains PR dossiers created during archaeology.

## File Naming

`pr-NNN.md` where NNN is the GitHub PR number.

## Schema

See [`../FORENSICS_SCHEMA.md`](../FORENSICS_SCHEMA.md) for the dossier template.

## Purpose

Extract lessons from merged PRs:

- What went wrong (and was caught vs. slipped through)
- What the combined budget actually was (DevLT + compute)
- Which guardrails improved because of the PR
- How claims drifted from implementation

Aggregate findings go to [`../LESSONS.md`](../LESSONS.md).
