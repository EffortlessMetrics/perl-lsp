## 2025-05-23 - Command Injection in Perl Debugger Interface
**Vulnerability:** `perl-dap`'s `evaluate` command allowed newline injection, enabling execution of arbitrary debugger commands (and potentially shell commands via `!`) because expressions were directly interpolated into the debugger input stream.
**Learning:** Interfacing with line-based CLI tools (like `perl -d`) requires strict sanitation of inputs to prevent protocol injection. The `DebugAdapter` assumed single-line inputs but didn't enforce it.
**Prevention:** Validate all user-supplied strings that are passed to CLI tools via stdin, specifically checking for control characters like newlines that could alter the command structure.
